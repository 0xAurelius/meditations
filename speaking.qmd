I love speaking to diverse audiences about both big ideas and the specific
projects I am working on. I can give  punchy 10 minute presentations that
concisely communicate complex concepts, as well as longer presentations that
dig deep and provide enough history and context to fill an hour.

Some of my previous apperances include multiple Schelling Points
(Denver, Amsterdam, Bogota) and Sustainable Blockchain Summits
(Paris, Bogota, Boston), as well as DeFiDay Amsterdam, ETHPorto and DeFiCon
NYC. I have also appeared on podcasts such as
[Greenpill](https://greenpill.substack.com/p/22-klimadao) and
[Quorum](https://podcast.quorummedia.xyz/marcus-aurelius/).

From crowded conference halls to intimate gatherings of builders and
intellectuals, I've delivered lectures, facilitated roundtables, and appeared
on numerous panels. Here's a [playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4QMMJ-cxd55QmqznDQtzKqlr6COyOqV_)
with most of my recorded speaking engagements, or see
[this tag](/#category=speaking) on this blog for some past talks I've highlighted.

I also enjoy mentoring and judging hackathons, having mentored at ETHDenver,
ETHBogota and ETHPorto, as well as mentored and judged at Good Hack NYC.

Iâ€™d love to work together on your next event!
