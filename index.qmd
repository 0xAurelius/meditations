## **_Meditations of a Pragmatic Philosopher_**

In the spirit of my pseudonymous namesake's original
[Meditations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations), this site features
a [collection of musings](/blog.html) about my personal journey, as well as
observations about the organizations and communities in which I operate.

See [this post](/posts/personal-journey/) for more about my background and the
origins of this blog.

_NOTE: all posts are living documents and may be updated for accuracy and_
_completeness after original posting._
