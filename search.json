    "text": "I relish any opportunity to speak with diverse audiences about both big ideas and the specific projects I am working on. I can give punchy 10 minute presentations that concisely communicate complex concepts, as well as longer presentations that dig deep and provide enough history and context to fill an hour.\nSome of my previous apperances include multiple Schelling Points (Denver, Amsterdam, Bogota) and Sustainable Blockchain Summits (Paris, Bogota, Boston), as well as DeFiDay Amsterdam, ETHPorto and DeFiCon NYC. I have also appeared on podcasts such as Greenpill and Quorum.\nFrom crowded conference halls to intimate gatherings of builders and intellectuals, I’ve delivered lectures, facilitated roundtables, and appeared on numerous panels. Here’s a playlist on YouTube with most of my recorded speaking engagements, or see this tag on this blog for some past talks I’ve highlighted.\nI also enjoy mentoring and judging hackathons, having mentored at ETHDenver, ETHBogota and ETHPorto, as well as mentored and judged at Good Hack NYC.\nI’d love to work together on your next event!\nFor personal appearances at events or on podcasts, please reach out to me via email or direct message on Twitter.\nFor inquiries directly related to KlimaDAO, please email marcus@klimadao.finance and include press@klimadao.finance under cc."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I had a blast engaging in spirited debate with Seraphim (Euler Finance) and Frank (Oasis), two thoughtful and innovative DeFi builders.\nWhile Frank was framed as the antagonist, advocating that Ponzinomics are an inherently unsustainable mechanism, I clearly articulated my position that Ponzinomics can be useful for incentivizing early adoption, but is not a value proposition in and of itself.\nThe key difference that turns a project utilizing Ponzinomics to incentivize early adopters into a Ponzi scheme is the lack of a clear path to generating real value for real users. As long as there is a legitimate value proposition to the products or services provided by the project, it’s not appropriate to accuse that project of being a Ponzi scheme.\nI love this debate format for panels, it’s much more engaging for both panelists and the audience when there are principled disagreements and spicy takes playing out live on-stage. I hope more event organizers learn from the wonderful team at CryptoCanal, and go beyond crowded generic panels where the moderator just goes down the line asking stock questions."

    "text": "Entering the Dark Forest\nIt was just another Monday evening watching the latest Bankless episode on YouTube, but the more I heard the more I realized this was not just another crypto project. The idea of using blockchain technology to bring greater transparency and efficiency to climate finance struck me as a perfect combination of my experience with data and my longstanding desire to contribute my professional skills to support climate action.\nLater that night I was pouring over the documentation and Discord, considering whether to put some of my own money at risk to support the project. This is what I’d been looking for: an opportunity to use my capital and skills to make a difference.\nBut things were not all sunny in paradise.\nIn the lead up to launch, there were many concerned and confused Klimates. I was quickly deputized as a moderator for my early work answering questions and helping people troubleshoot issues. The Core Team was busy and pulled in a million directions, so I did my best to keep the Discord under control, building Discord bots for Q/A and common metrics people were constantly asking for.\nLaunch was the most intense 48 hours of my life. We were on a voice chat for 16 hours straight, squashed bug after bug, and addressed hundreds of individual questions and issues. In the wake of the launch, there were suddenly hundreds of people who wanted to contribute to the DAO - utter chaos ensued, and I found myself called upon to lead."

    "text": "The Call to Adventure\nAround November or December, the Core Team first offered me to come aboard as a Core Contributor. At first I rejected the call to adventure, worried about the risk and instability of leaving my comfortable corporate AdTech data engineering gig to run my own company and provide services to a DAO.\nBut around the end of the year, my previous company got acquired at just the right moment to give me a little cash and a good reason to move on to a new adventure."

True to their innovative nature, we conducted a live offsetting demo that gave our team valueable insights about how best to integrate carbon credit retirement into live events.\nOf course the food at the event was amazing, and I really appreciated the TFF team’s commitment to mitigate emissions where possible and offset any residual emissions. Making this the norm for live events will be a critical driver of novel, consistent demand for consuming ecological benefit assets like carbon credits."
