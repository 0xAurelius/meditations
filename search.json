    "title": "Bootstrapping Impact Markets @ ETHPrague 2023",
    "section": "",
    "text": "It was a joy to visit the beautiful city of Prague and speak at the historic Paralelni Polis. ETHPrague brought together some of the sharpest minds in Ethereum, open-source software and distributed computing, alongside solarpunks and the ReFi community.\nThere is growing excitement about new environmental assets that fund impact “beyond just carbon.” However, after about 30 years since the first voluntary carbon market, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), was created under the Kyoto Protocol, carbon markets themselves are still quite immature, and there are plenty of lessons to learn from their development thus far.\nIn this talk, I go over the basic structure of impact markets, discuss how carbon markets implement that structure, and some insights about how to bootstrap new impact markets.\nI specifically highlight the tension between liquidity and fungibility for building scalable markets. Since a given environmental project will only create a certain number of impact certficates, the number of comparable assets may be quite small, which limits liquidity.\nHowever, deep liquidity is necessary to support sophisticated financial instruments (e.g. forward funding, insurance). Given the high up-front funding requirements for environmental impact projects, spot liquidity is critical to ensure project developers and financiers have reliable prices to discount against.\nI also highlight the ongoing work at KlimaDAO to bootstrap new strata in the digital carbon market by forward funding carbon projects using treasury capital, then once those credits are delivered, deploying a new liquidity pool that prices that type of project. For instance, KlimaDAO funded a cookstove project in a refugee camp in Bangladesh under the Gold Standard, and a forestry project in Africa under Verra’s Verified Carbon Standard. Upon delivery, proposals will be advanced to use these credits to create a spot liquidity pool for the EEIMP (small scale energy efficiency) and ARBO (afforestation and reforestation) carbon pools proposed by KlimaDAO’s bridging partner C3.\nThese new liquidity pools will then provide real-time pricing data for spot credits of those types, so that financiers and project developers can negotiate forward funding for new, similar carbon projects on a level playing field. Project developers will also be able to access liquidity immediately upon delivery, rather than waiting to offload their credits to a buyer."

Many of the speakers before me had broad sweeping presentations, attempting to communicate a massive amount of information using dense slides and broad sweeping narratives. This led someone in the audience to ask the same question at the end of each talk: “What have you actually delivered to date?”\nHaving learned the perils of dense, text-heavy slides from this excellent talk about how to speak, I made sure my slides had the minimum text necessary, and I emphasized just a few key takeaways. Thankfully KlimaDAO has plenty of live, production systems to highlight, and I’ve explained the basics of carbon markets so often that I was able to keep my messaging very simple."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I had a blast engaging in spirited debate with Seraphim (Euler Finance) and Frank (Oasis), two thoughtful and innovative DeFi builders.\nWhile Frank was framed as the antagonist, advocating that Ponzinomics are an inherently unsustainable mechanism, I clearly articulated my position that Ponzinomics can be useful for incentivizing early adoption, but is not a value proposition in and of itself.\nThe key difference that turns a project utilizing Ponzinomics to incentivize early adopters into a Ponzi scheme is the lack of a clear path to generating real value for real users. As long as there is a legitimate value proposition to the products or services provided by the project, it’s not appropriate to accuse that project of being a Ponzi scheme.\nI love this debate format for panels, it’s much more engaging for both panelists and the audience when there are principled disagreements and spicy takes playing out live on-stage. I hope more event organizers learn from the wonderful team at CryptoCanal, and go beyond crowded generic panels where the moderator just goes down the line asking stock questions."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This short talk highlights a structural problem in the traditional carbon market, where the infrequent but large purchases from corporate end-users of carbon credits leads to very “chunky” demand. In turn, holders of carbon credits become very defensive about their inventory and price data, leading to opacity, fragmentation and lack of liquidity.\nTo address this issue, I highlight novel demand sources being developed by KlimaDAO, from automated retirements on DeFi applications like Sushi to compensating for emissions from live events, or even integrating carbon credits into social media applications.\nAt the event, this talk was the seed for a breakout session, where I moderated a lively discussion about potential demand sources that could address the chunky demand problem. One of the most interesting ideas to come out of that discussion was to offer carbon credit retirement as an optional benefit to employees via a payroll provider like TriNet or ADP - and now I’m trying to develop a partnership with a small crypto-forward payroll provider to try something like that out!"

Carbon credit standards set rules and requirements to ensure the quality and integrity of these credits. Standards provide methodologies for measuring, monitoring and verifying the GHG benefits of different types of activities, such as renewable energy, forest conservation, or waste management.\nIn this post, I explore how existing carbon credit standards develop and maintain methodologies, as well as how decentralized governance mechanisms can facilitate destruction of credits from deprecated methodologies - leading to a more robust carbon market, better equipped to adapt to evolving scientific consensus."

    "text": "Example: Verra’s Verified Carbon Standard (VCS)\nVerra is a non-profit organization that manages several standards and programs for climate action and sustainable development, including the VCS Program, which is the world’s most widely used GHG crediting program. The VCS Program has issued over one billion carbon credits from thousands of projects in 80 countries.\nThe VCS Program has its own methodologies that have been approved for use by Verra, as well as methodologies from other approved GHG programs, such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and the Climate Action Reserve (CAR). All methodologies undergo a review and consultation process to ensure they meet the rules and requirements of the VCS Program.\nVerra periodically reviews VCS methodologies to ensure they continue to reflect best practices, scientific consensus, and evolving market conditions and technical developments in a sector.\nHowever, there is no standardized mechanism in the methodology governance process for deprecating an approved methodology if/when it reaches end-of-life - though, as we’ll see, several methodologies have been “phased out” ad hoc over the years."

    "text": "Leveraging Public Governance\nThis is a clear coordination failure: no new credits would be issued under the methodology, yet there was no mechanism to signal that the market had moved on from the existing credits and destroy them once and for all to prevent further use.\nOf course, Verra did not originate this methodology - it was originally developed under the CDM - but it did continue to allow retirement of these credits after ceasing issuance. Under its current Terms of Use, Verra lacks the ability to unilaterally destroy properly issued credits held by registry users, and registry users have no incentive to destroy their own assets.\nAs the situation became clear to the KlimaDAO community, Toucan implemented a restriction on the BCT pool to prevent more HFC-23 credits from being added to the pool. However, just like the off-chain market, the Digital Carbon Market had now inherited a significant chunk of these credits."

    "text": "Sorting the Laundry\nSeeing this as an opportunity to exercise the unique advantages of KlimaDAO’s public governance mechanism, I helped conduct an investigation into the history and activity of these credits.\nOn one hand, academic research indicated that some HFC-23 decomposition projects had been properly implemented, potentially even under-crediting - while other projects had engaged in deliberate over-creditng by producing more refrigerant than they would under a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario.\nHowever, based on the Verra public registry data on retirements, I found that credits from I found that this methodology had not been used for retirement in about 2 years.\nAs such, the path forward was clear to me: even if the particular project whose credits ended up in the KlimaDAO treasury were from a project that did not abuse the system, and issued at a time when the methodology was still actively used for retirement, those credits were objectively no longer being used, and therefore did not warrant going inclusion in the digital carbon market.\nSo I began to prepare a governance proposal which would destroy all of the HFC-23 credits in the BCT pool. I also approached Toucan for assistance in the process, both in terms of capital to destroy the credits and a special function to allow burning of credits from the pool without paying the selective redemption fee.\nSeveral weeks later, KLIMA token holders voted definitively to destroy the HFC-23 credits."

    "text": "Now that I’ve been working with carbon credit data for a couple of years, it seems to me that the incumbent players like Verra have no incentive to make their data easily available and interoperable. While this data is ostensibly public, their terms of service are pretty vague about what constitutes appropriate use, and without the project data then claims about the underlying activity are impossible to verify. As the number of credit issuance systems increases, and interoperable public infrastructure like the KlimaDAO retirement aggregator are built to seamlessly integrate different types of credits, it is critically important that project and issuance data from the registries is made publicly available in an efficient and standardized manner.\nIn this talk, I basically invoke this xkcd comic to point out that we need a unified, open data standard for carbon credits:\nhttps://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png\nTo flesh out my point, I lay out some of the limitations of the current registry-specific data models, reference some existing frameworks such as the UN SDGs and Planetary Boundaries, as well as point toward ongoing initiatives like the Ecological Benefits Frame Activator (of which I am a participant) and the Climate Action Data Trust (in whose user forum KlimaDAO has applied to participate).\nFinally, I provide an overview of the phased approach that KlimaDAO is taking to integrate carbon credit registry data given our need to ship products that work today, while preparing for a future where there are many more systems to integrate with and (hopefully) a standardized data model toward which to migrate."

The idea of using blockchain technology to bring greater transparency and efficiency to climate finance struck me as a perfect combination of my experience with data and my longstanding desire to contribute my professional skills to support climate action.\nLater that night I was pouring over the documentation and Discord, considering whether to put some of my own money at risk to support the project. This is what I’d been looking for: an opportunity to use my capital and skills to make a difference.\nBut things were not all sunny in paradise.\nIn the lead up to launch, there were many concerned and confused Klimates. I was quickly deputized as a moderator for my early work answering questions and helping people troubleshoot issues. The Core Team was busy and pulled in a million directions, so I did my best to keep the Discord under control, building Discord bots for Q/A and common metrics people were constantly asking for.\nLaunch was the most intense 48 hours of my life. We were on a voice chat for 16 hours straight, squashed bug after bug, and addressed hundreds of individual questions and issues. In the wake of the launch, there were suddenly hundreds of people who wanted to contribute to the DAO - utter chaos ensued, and I found myself called upon to lead."
