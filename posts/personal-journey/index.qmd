# Humble Beginnings, Great Expectations



# Leaving the Ordinary World Behind

It was just another Monday evening watching the [latest Bankless episode on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM5XX4AwEuI), but
the more I heard the more I realized this was not just another crypto project.
Later that night I was pouring over the documentation and Discord, considering
whether to put some of my own money at risk to support the project. This is what
I'd been looking for: an opportunity to use my capital and skills to make a difference.

But things were not all sunny in paradise.

In the lead up to launch, there were many concerned and confused Klimates. I
was quickly deputized as a moderator for my early work answering questions and helping
people troubleshoot issues. The Core Team was busy and pulled in a million directions,
so I did my best to keep the Discord under control, building Discord bots for Q/A and
common metrics people were constantly asking for.

Launch was the most intense 48 hours of my life. We were on a voice chat for 16 hours straight,
squashed bug after bug, and addressed hundreds of individual questions and issues.

In the wake of the launch, there were suddenly hundreds of people volunteering
to contribute to the DAO.

Around November or December, the Core Team first offered me to come aboard as a
Core Contributor. At first I rejected the call to adventure, worried about the
risk and instability of leaving my comfortable corporate AdTech data engineering
gig to run my own company and provide services to a DAO.

But in the end my old company got acquired at just the right moment to give me
a little cash and a good reason to move on to a new adventure.

# Documenting the Adventure



While I will carefully maintain the consistency of which identity is tied to which
projects, I will use this blog as a place to make observations as a whole person -
which may occassionally blur the line between my personas.
