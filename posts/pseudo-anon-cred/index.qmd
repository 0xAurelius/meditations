[Much noise has been made](https://decrypt.co/76997/elizabeth-warren-crypto-big-banks-shadowy-super-coders) about the prevalence of pseudnymous and anonymous contributors 
in the web3 space. Perhaps most famously, the Bitcoin whitepaper and initial
software was released by "Satoshi Nakamoto" - an individual or group of 
individuals whose identity still has yet to be definitively revealed, 
despite [multiple](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjr6rXdlfD_AhVR8bsIHTd5Bu4QFnoECA8QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coindesk.com%2Fpolicy%2F2022%2F09%2F19%2Fcraig-wrights-satoshi-proofs-not-credible-and-a-farce-hodlonaut-lawyers-say%2F&usg=AOvVaw3WN72i2zvLKOi68_txXz8l&opi=89978449)

# Historical Context

It is important to distinguish between a **pseudonym** (also known as a "pen name" or "stage name") and
a proper **anonymous identity**. Historically, many intellectuals, writers and artists have operated under pseudonyms.
From a group of America's Founding Fathers publishing the [Federalist Papers under the shared
pseudnym "Publius"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers) to beloved authors such as [Mark Twain](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjk5fnSlvD_AhXhg_0HHaxMCL0QFnoECBEQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMark_Twain&usg=AOvVaw1ghZ7j4uP1pkogdLX88Yb-&opi=89978449), 
these people had different reasons for obscuring the connection between their work and their legal
identities. In the modern era, countless artists operate under pseudonyms, from [Grimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimes) to [Gorillaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillaz).

Truly anonymous identities are more rare in professional context, even among artists. For instance, [Banksy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksy)
has maintained an anonymous identity for decades, presumably because his chosen medium (graffiti) is
illegal in many jurisdictions.

Voltaire, Benjamin Franklin, authors like CS Lewis (?), HG Wells (a woman!) and Mark Twain

# Legitimate Motivations for Pseudonymity

In our era of extreme credentialism, where a diploma from the right school or
work experience at the right company opens doors that are sealed shut for otherwise
skilled and thoughtful people, pseudonymity and anonymity can be powerful tools to disrupt
incumbent power structures. That said, they can also be abused to conceal malicious behavior.

## Broadcast Values

People often remark on my pseudonym because they're familiar with the historical figure
of Marcus Aurelius, and/or resonate with Stoic virtues - an easy starting point for meaningful conversation
that short-circuits small talk.

## Avoid capitalizing on credentials



Differentiate between pseudo and anon, explain different motivations for each,
delve into 

The idea is not to buy into the entrenched credentialist system and take advantage of prestige or connections,
but rather to recognize the pragmatic need to leverage credentials where relevant/appropriate,
while not relying on them in place of demonstrating your merit by consistently producing high quality output

# Legitimate Motivations for Anonymity

- Personal privacy
- Speak truth to power

Consider a truly anonymous artist like Banksy, who deliberately makes efforts to
conceal their identity, accruing value and reputation to their anonymous identity.

Or the case of female writers such as George Eliot, whose work would have been
dismissed based on her scandalous elopement with a married man. 

# Risks of Anonymity

Case of Sifu, who used a pseudonym to obscure his past

That said, people do deserve the right to redeem themselves through demonstrated
good work

Misbehavior and evil will always exist, and while anonymity may provide a mask,
bad behavior cannot be prevented by indiscriminate suspicion of anyone operating
under a name different from their legal name. Countless tyrants have carried out
egregious acts, despite their legal name and identity being fully public.

# Endgame Strategies

## Disappear

As is the case with Nakamoto, a simple endgame is to allow the identity to 
fade into history, 

## Maintain

As long as the human or group of humans behind the identity remain, they can
continue to maintain the identity via regular output of work products attributed
to the identity.

## Integrate

# Pseudonymity and Anonymity in the Age of Generative Models

Now that text, images and other products can be generated progammatically using
[foundation models]() like GPT and Stable Diffusion, identities have become
even more detached from a particular human.

There are already AI-generated music acts, complete with visual avatars.

# Personal Motivations for Maintaining a Pseudonym

KlimaDAO but to
explicitly reveal my identity for Playgrounds (want to help Playgrounds succeed and my data science and data engineering credentials are beneficial in that context)
