Differentiate between pseudo and anon, explain different motivations for each,
delve into personal motivations for choosing to be pseudo on KlimaDAO but to
explicitly reveal my identity for Playgrounds (want to help Playgrounds succeed and my data science and data engineering credentials are beneficial in that context)

The idea is not to buy into the entrenched credentialist system and take advantage of prestige or connections,
but rather to recognize the pragmatic need to leverage credentials where relevant/appropriate,
while not relying on them in place of demonstrating your merit by consistently producing high quality output
