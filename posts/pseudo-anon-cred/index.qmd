Differentiate between pseudo and anon, explain different motivations for each,
delve into personal motivations for choosing to be pseudo on KlimaDAO but to
explicitly reveal my identity for Playgrounds (want to help Playgrounds succeed and my data science and data engineering credentials are beneficial in that context)

The idea is not to buy into the entrenched credentialist system and take advantage of prestige or connections,
but rather to recognize the pragmatic need to leverage credentials where relevant/appropriate,
while not relying on them in place of demonstrating your merit by consistently producing high quality output

Reference historical pseudonymous writers and artists such as Voltaire, Benjamin Franklin, founding fathers who wrote the Federalist Papers, authors like CS Lewis (?), HG Wells (a woman!) and Mark Twain

Reasons to operate pseudo vs reasons to remain anon

Pseudo
- Broadcast your values
- Avoid capitalizing on credentials

Anon
- Personal privacy
- Speak truth to power

People often remark on my pseudo because they're familiar with the historical figure
and/or resonate with Stoic virtues - an easy starting point for conversation

Contrast with anonymous artists like Banksy who deliberately make efforts to
conceal their identity and accrue value and reputation to their
anonymous identity.
