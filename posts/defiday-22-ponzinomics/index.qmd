I had a blast engaging in spirited debate with Seraphim (Euler Finance) and
Frank (Oasis), two thoughtful and innovative DeFi builders.

While Frank was framed as the antagonist, advocating that Ponzinomics are
an inherently unsustainable mechanism, I clearly articulated my position
that Ponzinomics can be useful for incentivizing early adoption, but is not
a value proposition in and of itself.

The key difference that turns a project utilizing Ponzinomics to incentivize
early adopters into a Ponzi scheme is the lack of a clear path to generating
real value for real users. As long as there is a legitimate value proposition
to the products or services provided by the project, it's not appropriate to
accuse that project of being a Ponzi scheme.

I love this debate format for panels, it's much more engaging for both panelists
and the audience when there are principled disagreements and spicy takes playing
out live on-stage. I hope more event organizers learn from the wonderful team at
[CryptoCanal](https://www.cryptocanal.org/), and go beyond crowded generic
panels where the moderator just goes down the line asking stock questions.
