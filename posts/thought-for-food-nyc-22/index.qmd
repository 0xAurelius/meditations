<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/791229811">Marcus Aurelius at TFF Generation Fest 2022</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/thoughtforfoodorg">Thought For Food</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

It was truly a pleasure to speak at and help offset the carbon emissions
associated with Thought For Food's fantastic annual event in New York City.
True to their innovative nature, we conducted a live offsetting demo that
gave our team valueable insights about how best to integrate carbon credit
retirement into live events.

Of course the food at the event was amazing, and I really appreciated the TFF
team's commitment to mitigate emissions where possible and offset any residual
emissions. Making this the norm for live events will be a critical driver of
novel, consistent demand for consuming ecological benefit assets like carbon
credits.
