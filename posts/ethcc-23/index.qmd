EthCC is one of the largest annual Ethereum conferences, and it was a joy to be back in Paris again to share
the latest developments in the Digital Carbon Market. 

I spoke toward the end of a set of a back-to-back talks from different projects applying blockchain to carbon markets. Many of
the speakers before me had broad sweeping presentations, attempting to communicate a massive amount of information using dense slides and broad sweeping narratives.
This led someone in the audience to ask the same question at the end of each talk: "What have you actually delivered to date?"

Having learned the perils of dense, text-heavy slides from [this excellent talk about how to speak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY), 
I made sure my slides had the minimum text necessary, and I emphasized just a few key takeaways.
Thankfully KlimaDAO has plenty of live, production systems to highlight, and I've explained the basics of
carbon markets so often that I was able to keep my messaging very simple.
