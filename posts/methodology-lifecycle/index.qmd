Carbon credits quantify the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions or removals 
achieved by projects or programs around the world that mitigate climate change. 
Carbon credit standards set rules and requirements to ensure the quality and 
integrity of these credits. Standards provide methodologies for measuring, monitoring and verifying the GHG benefits of different types of 
activities, such as renewable energy, forest conservation, or waste management.

In this post, I explore how existing carbon credit standards develop and
maintain methodologies, as well as how decentralized governance mechanisms can 
facilitate destruction of credits from deprecated methodologies - leading to a
more robust carbon market, better equipped to adapt to evolving scientific consensus.

# What is a Methodology Anyway?

Much like a lab experiment you might have done in grade-school science class,
a methodology specifies a detailed set of steps and procedures to reproduce
a particular result. 

A carbon credit methodology will typically specify:
- the **applicability conditions** under which the activity should take place
- how to define the **boundaries** of a project
- how to construct an appropriate **baseline** (i.e. demonstrate that the
project activities actually make a difference relative to the status quo)
- how to **quantify the greenhouse gas emissions** avoided or removed by the activity
- how to **monitor** the project to ensure the intended results are realized

# Status Quo Methodology Development

The first verified carbon credit system, the [Clean Development Mechanism](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms-under-the-kyoto-protocol/the-clean-development-mechanism),
was created 30 years ago under the Kyoto Protocol. Since then, 
the governance mechanisms for carbon credit standards have not changed much.
In particular, they tend to favor opaque submission and review processes where most 
activities are carried out by permissioned insiders (e.g. staff at the standards body).
While standards typically feature a public comment period in their methodology development
process, the submitted comments are not published in full, and it is difficult to tell
if issues that were raised have been properly addressed.

## Example: Verra's Verified Carbon Standard (VCS)

[Verra](https://verra.org/) is a non-profit organization that manages several standards and programs 
for climate action and sustainable development, including the VCS Program, which
 is the worldâ€™s most widely used GHG crediting program. 
The VCS Program has issued over one billion carbon credits from thousands of 
projects in 80 countries.

The VCS Program has its own methodologies that have been approved for use by Verra, 
as well as methodologies from other approved GHG programs, such as the 
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and the Climate Action Reserve (CAR). All 
methodologies undergo a [review and consultation 
process](https://verra.org/methodologies-main/develop-a-methodology/) to ensure they meet the rules and requirements of the VCS Program.

Verra periodically reviews VCS methodologies to ensure they continue to reflect best practices, 
scientific consensus, and evolving market conditions and technical developments in 
a sector.

# Cleaning Up a Decade-Old Mess

During the joint launch of [Toucan's one-way carbon bridge](https://docs.toucan.earth/toucan/bridge/carbon-bridge)
and [KlimaDAO](https://klimadao.finance), about 700,000 
tonnes of carbon credits were bridged from the Verra registry issued under the AM0001 
methodology for decomposition of HFC-23 (a byproduct from production of refrigerant).

This particular [methodology was originally developed under the CDM](https://cdm.unfccc.int/methodologies/DB/GAOZAY2DWIQHK71LJS027N6N4AV6SC), 
and was carried forward into Verra's VCS. However, in the wake of the Montreal Protocol, which
established mandatory commitments at the national level for preventing emissions of
hydroflourocarbons like HFC-23, Verra subsequently [ceased issuance of credits under
any methodology related to HFC-23](https://verra.org/phasing-out-hfc-23-projects/).

The HFC-23 methodology was also called into question because of concerns that some project
developers were [producing more refrigerant than they actually had buyers for,
simply to issue carbon credits based on the decomposition of the HFC-23 byproduct](https://carbonbetter.com/story/additionality/).

After the methodology was discontinued by Verra, no steps were taken to 
address the millions of tonnes of credits which were issued under this methodology
and remained on the books of many carbon market participants. This created ambiguity 
around the value of these assets, and led many in the carbon markets to 
conveniently forget about their existence. Nonetheless, for years after the 
deprecation of the methodology, transactions and retirements continued in the 
shadows of the over-the-counter (OTC) market. 

## Leveraging Public Governance

This is a clear coordination failure: no new credits would be issued under the
methodology, yet there was no mechanism to signal that the market had moved on
from the existing credits and destroy them once and for all to prevent further use.

Of course, Verra did not originate this methodology - it was originally developed under 
the CDM - but it did continue to allow retirement of these credits after ceasing issuance.
Under its current Terms of Use, Verra lacks the ability to unilaterally 
destroy properly issued credits held by registry users, and registry users have no incentive
to destroy their own assets.

As the situation became clear to the KlimaDAO community, Toucan implemented a restriction
on the BCT pool to prevent more HFC-23 credits from being added to the pool. However,
just like the off-chain market, the Digital Carbon Market had now inherited a significant
chunk of these credits.

## Sorting the Laundry

Seeing this as an opportunity to exercise the unique advantages of KlimaDAO's
public governance mechanism, I helped conduct an investigation into the 
history and activity of these credits. 

On one hand, [academic research](https://www.rff.org/publications/working-papers/the-net-emissions-impact-of-hfc-23-offset-projects-from-the-clean-development-mechanism/)
indicated that some HFC-23 decomposition projects had been properly implemented, 
potentially even under-crediting - while other projects had engaged
in deliberate over-creditng by producing more refrigerant than they would 
under a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario.

However, based on the Verra [public registry data](https://registry.verra.org/app/search/VCS/VCUs) on retirements, I found that credits from 
I found that this methodology had not been used for retirement in about 2 years.

As such, the path forward was clear to me: even if the particular project whose credits
ended up in the KlimaDAO treasury were from a project that did not abuse the system,
and issued at a time when the methodology was still actively used for retirement, 
those credits were objectively no longer being used, and therefore did not warrant going inclusion
in the digital carbon market.

So I began to prepare a governance proposal which would destroy all of the HFC-23
credits in the BCT pool. I also approached Toucan for assistance in the process,
both in terms of capital to destroy the credits and a special function to allow
burning of credits from the pool without paying the selective redemption fee.

Several weeks later, [KLIMA token holders voted definitively to destroy the HFC-23 credits](https://snapshot.org/#/klimadao.eth/proposal/0x2ae3fce131f98bf22ec9ef306a13e359002eaea0d111328149204dfd9dc9b2e4).

# Murphy's Law for Methodologies

Based on this experience I propose a corollary of [Murphy's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law)
for carbon credit methodologies:

> No methodology is perfect - therefore all methodologies will be criticized.

Criticism and scrutiny is absolutely essential to progress this market and develop
the most effective and impactful methodologies. But when that data-driven, scientific
criticism is wrapped up into an overly simplistic narrative and shouted from the rootops,
it can disrupt the market.

Rather than abandoning a methodology wholesale based on simplistic narratives, 
the carbon market needs mechanisms to deliberately evolve over time. The goal should be 
to avoid disrupting project developers midflight, and prevent an inefficient race to 
the top of the price curve, which distorts the relationship between price, cost and 
efficiency.

KlimaDAO established a precedent to maintain support for a given methodology until
market participants have not utilized that asset for retirement purposes in years.
As new supply comes online and KlimaDAO integrates that supply into its ecosystem and treasury,
the HFC-23 situation provides an example of progressively improving the carbon
markets using public governance.
